# Testing and Debugging MERN Applications

This assignment focuses on implementing comprehensive testing strategies for a MERN stack application, including unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing, along with debugging techniques.

## Assignment Overview

You will:
1. Set up testing environments for both client and server
2. Write unit tests for React components and server functions
3. Implement integration tests for API endpoints
4. Create end-to-end tests for critical user flows
5. Apply debugging techniques for common MERN stack issues

## Getting Started

1. Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment invitation
2. Clone your personal repository that was created by GitHub Classroom
3. Follow the setup instructions in the `Week6-Assignment.md` file
4. Explore the starter code and existing tests
5. Complete the tasks outlined in the assignment

## Files Included

- `Week6-Assignment.md`: Detailed assignment instructions
- Starter code for a MERN application with basic test setup:
  - Sample React components with test files
  - Express routes with test files
  - Jest and testing library configurations
  - Example tests for reference

## Requirements

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- MongoDB (local installation or Atlas account)
- npm or yarn
- Basic understanding of testing concepts

## Testing Tools

- Jest: JavaScript testing framework
- React Testing Library: Testing utilities for React
- Supertest: HTTP assertions for API testing
- Cypress/Playwright: End-to-end testing framework
- MongoDB Memory Server: In-memory MongoDB for testing

## Submission

Your work will be automatically submitted when you push to your GitHub Classroom repository. Make sure to:

1. Complete all required tests (unit, integration, and end-to-end)
2. Achieve at least 70% code coverage for unit tests
3. Document your testing strategy in the README.md
4. Include screenshots of your test coverage reports
5. Demonstrate debugging techniques in your code

# Bug Tracker Application

This project implements a Bug Tracker application as part of the Testing and Debugging MERN Applications assignment.

## Features

- Create new bug reports
- View list of reported bugs
- Update bug status
- Delete bug reports

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd mern-bug-tracker
   npm install
   cd client
   npm install
   cd ../server
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure environment variables:
   - Create `.env` in server directory
   - Add MongoDB connection string
   - Set PORT and other configurations

## Testing Strategy

### Backend Tests
- Unit tests for bug validation logic
- Integration tests for CRUD operations
- API endpoint testing using Supertest
- Database operations using MongoDB Memory Server

### Frontend Tests
- Component rendering tests
- Form validation tests
- API integration tests
- Error boundary tests

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run backend tests
cd server
npm test

# Run frontend tests
cd client
npm test

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
```

## Debugging Techniques

1. Server-side debugging:
   - Using Node.js inspector
   - Winston logger implementation
   - Error middleware stack traces

2. Client-side debugging:
   - React DevTools
   - Network request monitoring
   - Error Boundaries
   - Console logging strategies
